# raw-keys-waynergy
The native Synergy/Barrier clients do not support Wayland, which make it neccesarry to utlize [waynergy](https://github.com/r-c-f/waynergy). As Waynergy on Gnome only supports raw input, a mapping between the Barrier Server Input and the uinput keyboard codes on Linux needs to be made.
This keyboard mapping maps a Mac Keyboard to Linux
